I want it to be the old way - where when you want to listen to songs by a certain artist, you click their name, and then have the \"all songs\" option instead of being forced to view by album. Now, the only way you can listen to all songs is if you hit Shuffle. But sometimes, I don't WANT it on shuffle. Sometimes I wanna start with a certain song and then just cycle through the rest. But NOPE, can't do that... not to mention that now, some songs are filed differently and I can't make it stop. For example, I wanted to listen to Say My Name the other day, which I OBVIOUSLY have on my phone, but it wasn't under Destiny's Child when I was looking through artists. I was super confused because I knew it should be there, so I went to scroll through songs, and it was there. I'm not sure why it wasn't in the artist group - I definitely have it labeled. Things like that are really frustrating. Some songs are filed by album artist, which I don't want and have tried to clear out, but any of the songs I downloaded through iTunes won't allow me to remove the album artist... I thought that removing that would force it to sort by artist, but nope. \n\nThen also, I don't want the \"other\" icon to show up. I keep thinking it means \"other\" songs I have by an artist that have no album listed or something, but NOPE it takes me to the music app store thing.\n\nBut anyways, I think I might just need to make one massive playlist of all the songs I want on there and sort it by artist.
