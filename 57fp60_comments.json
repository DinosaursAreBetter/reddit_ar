Feel free to skip the post altogether and scroll down to the fun stuff on here, I understand completely... really, I do. \n\nI am in a running funk right now. I hope it\u2019s just a post illness/hurricane/stress funk and nothing more. \n\nI got sick at the end of September, then raced the Isle of Palms Connector 10K. The race probably prolonged my recovery, and I didn\u2019t feel great the next week. I shifted around my workouts due to the hurricane, then realized I ran 60 miles in 7 days, while sick (including 2 long runs and 2 tempos). No wonder I was exhausted.\n\nMy legs just would not go on Wednesday at the track. Those 600s were super hard. I got through them, I hope it helps me for a future race. Maybe mentally. \n\nOur home- and most of the Charleston area- was fine after Hurricane Matthew. The Pee Dee area where my family lives and where my job is located were hit especially hard. Our office was closed on Monday, but as a remote employee, I still worked. In fact, I worked especially hard to make sure communication was on point for clients and employees. My company is a great place to work, and I can work in my sweats, so I don\u2019t mind, but it added my stress levels. \n\nI also have a feeling of helplessness, as my parents and Clay\u2019s parents suffered without power and with damage. Many of my coworkers still do not have power, and several had trees down in their neighborhoods that kept them from going to work when work resumed. Worse yet, three of my coworkers lost their homes due to flooding from Hurricane Matthew. \n\nClay's parents got power back yesterday. His mom keeps kids in her home for a living and I don't know how she did it with no electricity and electronics for all those children. My parents should get power back on Sunday. My mom stood in a Red Cross line yesterday to wait on hot plates of food so she and my dad could have a hot meal. She also found somewhere to go to take a hot shower so she could wash her hair and shave her legs (I told her not to do those things in a cold shower). I've invited them to stay with me and they just won't come (2 hour drive). Nor will they let me send them anything through Amazon/mail now that they can get mail. \n\nI got off the phone yesterday with my mom and burst into tears. It's the first time I've cried through all of this. \n\nI'm heading out in a bit for some miles. Also, I'll run my 16 this weekend for Charleston Marathon training if I wind up doing that race. Let's see how this goes...
